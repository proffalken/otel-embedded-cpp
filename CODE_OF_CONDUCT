# The Quick Version
Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. 

We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. 

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community event or content, including talks, workshops, parties, or online media.

# The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, 
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the project leader(s) may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or removing their ability to contribute to the project.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the repository maintainers immediately.
